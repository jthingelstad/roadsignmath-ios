# Road Sign Math for iPhone: agent guide

Road Sign Math is a road trip game: find a road sign whose numbers make a true
equation, photograph it, write the math, post it. This repo is the iPhone app.
The website and the server behind it are in
[roadsignmath.xyz](https://github.com/jthingelstad/roadsignmath.xyz).
`README.md` is the overview for people; this file is the working rules.

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. Do not fork them.

## Layout

- `RoadSignMathKit/` is a Swift package for everything that isn't a screen.
  - `SignReading`: Vision text recognition (`TextRecognizer`), the number rules
    (`NumberExtractor`: letters dropped, `7B` read as 7, times split in two,
    fractions) and `SignReader`, which reads a photo in passes and merges them.
    It builds for macOS too, so it runs headless on a Mac.
  - `SignReadingEval` and `sign-reading-eval`: the number-reading spike, which
    scores `SignReading` against signs with known numbers. See `docs/SPIKE.md`.
- The app's Xcode project comes in a later PR.

## Rules

- This repo is public. Never commit secrets, tokens, signing files, team ids,
  Apple account details, email addresses, local paths, or photos with plates
  or faces that aren't blurred. Signing lives in an ignored local file when the
  app arrives. Tools take every path as an argument.
- No third-party packages. Apple's frameworks only.
- iOS 26 and later, iPhone only, Swift 6 strict concurrency.
- No task groups (`withTaskGroup` and its kin). An optimized build has ended
  one before its children finished and crashed a sibling app on launch, while
  Debug, and every test, ran fine. Run work side by side as one `Task` each,
  awaited in turn.
- Keep the package's tests passing in Debug and optimized:

  ```sh
  swift test --package-path RoadSignMathKit
  swift test -c release -Xswiftc -enable-testing --package-path RoadSignMathKit
  ```

  CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs both on every PR. Actions are pinned
  by commit SHA.
- Every TestFlight upload, internal ones included, is Jamie's call each time.
  Merge as usual, then ask before uploading.
- Codex reviews every PR (`chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]`). Read its findings
  and fix or answer each one before calling the work done.
- What counts as a sign, what players are promised, and who sees what are
  product calls for Jamie. There are no points and no scoreboard.
